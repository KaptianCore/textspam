# Automated Text File Typer
A Script Originally Made By Mate Charlie And I Upgraded It With More Scripts, Random Picking Scripts And A Kill Switch :)

## How To Use!

Install The Requirements!

```pip install -r requirements```

Run The Script!

```py autotypescript.py```

Now it will print all the scripts that are in the script directory, type one out and then in 5 seconds it will start the typing. To stop it click escape a few times until it stops.

## Want More Scripts?

If you want more scripts feel free to open a [pull request](https://github.com/KaptianCore/textspam/pulls) with the file in there or for personal use just put it in the src/scripts folder and it will automatically be put in the random choice for the script to print out.
