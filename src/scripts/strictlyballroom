SCOTT:

Ha ha! Mr. Kendall!

Oh, Mum.

I was going to tell you...

Oh, yes.

Very funny, you little devil.

Well, we know all about it.

WAYNE:

Bloody fantastic, mate!

You should have told us,

you know.

Uncle Lessie

was onto it first.

SCOTT:

You haven't even

seen us dance yet.

Come on, son. You two

were made for each other!

DOUG:

I find it difficult

to get the films now.

It's all

video, video, video...

SHIRLEY:

For goodness sake, Doug.

She's not the slightest

bit interested.

Look at her.

She's beside herself.

Who would have thought it, eh?

Our Scott dancing with

someone like Tina Sparkle.

Yes.

PRESENTER:

The fairy princess...

of the dance floor,

Miss Tina Sparkle...

and for the last time...

Tina Sparkle.

Fran, l...

...Mr. Nathan Starkey!

SHIRLEY:

Oh, isn't Tina beautiful?

PRESENTER:

Ladies and gentlemen,

this evening...

dancing together

for the last time...

Mr. Nathan Starkey

and Miss Tina Sparkle.

What a great partnership...

and what a show...

as they dance for you

the Fruity Rumba.

She's a funny girl.

Be back in a minute.

Ah, the beginning...

with a lovely

double ronde shuffle.

Yes. Let's hear that applause.

Well-deserved.

Watch it, Frangipani!

Listen, sweetie...

I'm the one driving

the engine around here.

You're driving the engine?

What's that in the thermos?

Hi, Scott.

- Have you seen Fran?

- Fran? Fran who?

Jeez.

PRESENTER:

It's a double dip...

ah... into a quick

whip split! Beaut!

Oh, yes, a beautifully

arced crest move.

That will go down a treat

with the judges...

at the Pan Pacific this year.

Do you know where Scott went?

Excuse me.

All these steps

can be found...

on Barry Fife's

brilliant video "Dance to Win."

For 29.95, it's a must.

President Mr. Barry Fife

will be personally signing...

copies of his video

in the foyer.

Classy final, twilight lift.

Oh, look at this.

Fran, I didn't

know anything about that.

Are you going

to dance with Tina?

I...

She's a champion.

I think you should.

She's your style.

You'd really suit each other.

I've been working towards

winning the Pan Pacifics...

since I was six years old.

Beautifully struck.

I'm sure you'll win.

I could never do that.

Flowing into

the reverse whip split.

You won't admit you love me

And so how am I ever to know?

You always tell me,

"Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps"

A million times I've asked you

And then I ask you over again

You only answer,

"Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps"

If you can't make your mind up

We'll never get started

And I don't want to wind up

Being parted, broken-hearted

So if you really love me,

say yes

But if you don't, dear,

confess

And please don't tell me,

"Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps"

Shh, shh.

What's going on?

"Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps"

Ahem.

If you can't make your mind up

We'll never get started

And I don't want to wind up...

It's the inconceivable sight

of Scott dancing with Fran.

...broken-hearted

So if you really love me

Check it out.

Say yes

But if you don't, dear,

confess

And please don't tell me

"Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps"

"Perhaps, perhaps..."

You're kidding.

Fran.

Give them a big hand!

A shining example...

Quick, Tina's coming!

Give her a hand.

Scott, Tina's coming.

No! I'm helping Fran.

I don't want to hear it.

Les, give me a hand.

She'll be dancing

with a brand-new partner.

Tina, wonderful,

wonderful...

the fruit... everything.

Les, President Fife...

would like a word with

you and Scott... now!

What's going on?

Ah, silly accident.

This poor girl fell.

I'm Shirley Hastings.

Mum...

Scott,

Tina's been dying to meet you.

Look, Mum...

No, Scott.

We'll look after Fran.

You need to have a chat

with President Fife.

Better not keep him waiting.

We'll be back for the social.

Tina, take your time

getting changed.

Come on, Scott.

Scott.

A top routine, Teens.

Ugh.

I thought that was good.

Come on, come on.

I don't know what you two

thought you were doing.

There's obviously been

a lot of things going on...

but we're going to fix

that nasty bruise.

And then, Fran...

I think it would be best

for everyone if you went home.

You're a beginner, Fran.

What the hell did you think

you were doing?

And you're really clumsy.

That's why you fell over.

Scott wanted...

Well, of course

Scott would say that.

But you don't want to ruin

his chances, do you?

Do you?

Now...

You can see it would be best

for everybody concerned...

if you just went home

and forgot all about this...

can't you, Franny?

Can't you?

Yes, Mrs. Hastings.

I understand Les has lined you

up with Tina Sparkle.

Well, don't blow it, son...

because if you don't

start listening...

to your teachers

and superiors...

there won't be

a mark on the score card...

low enough for you

at the Pan Pacific.

Comprende?

Barry's only thinking

of your well being.

Where would we be

if everybody made up steps?

Out of a job.

Don't listen to him, Barry.

He's excited about

dancing with Tina.

He doesn't know

what he's saying. Scott!

Scott!

Now, we can't expect Tina

to wait around all night.

Yes, I know, Terry. I'm sorry.

Oh, Tina.

Oh, my goodness,

you look terrific.

What the hell

was that all about?

You know, with Fran.

Fran, Fran, Fran...

Fran?

Fran, Fran, Fran...

Fran. Wasn't she that girl...

Well, here we all are.

Where is she?

- Who?

- Fran.

Fran who?

Fran... you know,

the girl that fell.

Oh, she went home, darling.

Don't worry about her.

- What?

- She went shopping.

No, she had to make

a phone call.

You're pathetic.

What's wrong with you?

That's what I've been

trying to find out...

for the last three weeks, Wayne.

What's wrong with me?

What is so wrong

with the way I dance?

Ha ha ha ha...

Come on, now, Scott.

Tina's waiting.

You're all so scared...

you wouldn't know

what you thought.

Look, is he dancing

with Tina or not?

Yes.

I'm sorry, Tina.

I'm not available.

No, Scott! Wayne, Wayne!

- Well.

- Scott!

Aah! What's going on?

Care for a dance, Teens?

Jesus, you danced

impressively today.

Do you think so, Mr. Fife?

Oh, God, yes.

You should try a bogo pogo

in your samba, though.

It's a terrific step...

especially coming out

of a lock whisk.

Yeah, well, actually...

It's in me video.

You got one?

- Uh, well, no...

- Take this one.

Well, thanks, Mr. Fife.

You know,

Scott's not the only one...

with a future to think about.

It's Wayne, isn't it?

Yeah, Wayne.

Yeah. I've seen this bad

influence before, Wayne.

You know, one bad egg

can rot the whole barrel.

Know what I mean?

Hmm?

Fran.

What are you doing here?

I want to dance with you.

Go away. I'll get in trouble.

What happened to

"a life lived in fear"...

and all that stuff?

It's no use.

You were right. I'm a beginner.

I'll never be like them.

I don't want you

to be like them.

You're better than all of them.

Fran, I want to dance with you

at the Pan Pacifics.

We won't win.

I just want to dance our steps.

Francisca!

Es mi...

My dancing partner.

You go now!

Go! Go!

No!

We just dance together,

that's all!

What sort of dance do you dance

so late at night?

Paso doble.

Paso doble?

Tu bailas paso doble?

What?

You dance the paso doble?

Heh. Yeah.

Show. Show.

Yes. We want to see

this paso doble.

Come on.

Show us your paso doble.

Show me your paso doble.

Paso doble.

Hey, it's all right.

Just try and keep up.

Four count intro.

Ha ha ha!

What?

What's so funny?

Paso doble?

Paso doble.

Hey!

Grandma would like to teach us.

Ah ha ha.

Where do you feel the rhythm?

No, no, no, no.

Aqui y aqui.

Listen to the rhythm.

Don't be scared.

Follow.

Hey!

Muy bien. Muy bien.

Ha ha ha!

Have you eaten?

If you haven't, there's

some chops in the fridge.

No, I'm fine.

How could you?

How could you do that to Tina?

She's a Pan Pacific champion.

First thing in the morning,

you get on that phone...

and you apologize.

I won't be dancing with Tina.

What?

I'm dancing with Fran.

Fran! Doug, he said

he won't be dancing with Tina!

I heard.

Well, do something about it,

you silly man.

Why do you

pick on Dad all the time?

How dare you speak

to me like that?

The sacrifices

that we have made for you...

the money, the time,

and the effort.

Oh, shut up!

And what about Les?

He has taught you

everything you know...

and you're just throwing it

back in his face.

I'm bored with it.

I don't believe

that I'm hearing this!

I have been with your father

for 25 years!

Do you think I get bored?

Of course I do...

but you stick with your goals.

And eventually,

they bring their own rewards.

- What rewards?

- Winning the Pan Pacific.

I don't care about winning

the Pan Pacific Grand Prix!

Ohh!

He doesn't care about winning

the Pan Pacific Grand Prix?

That's what he said.

He just wants to dance

his silly steps with Fran.

Oh, that's great for

the studio, isn't it?

Wayne, don't let

your imagination...

run away with this.

It's true, Mrs. H.

It's like President Fife says...

"one bad egg can rot

the whole barrel."

No. You are all overreacting.

Nothing terrible

is going to happen!

Aah!

What?

Ken dropped me.

Oh... dear...

People will laugh at me.

Yes. You just got

not to be scared...

All right?

You remind me of your mother,

you know.

I am very proud of you.

And if...

if your mum was here...

she would be very proud, too.

Francisca!

Fran! Francisca!

It's too jazzy.

Don't throw away your energy.

See... keep the focus

between you.

The face is strong.

Si. Uno, dos, tres.

Hyah!

Uno, dos, tres.

Hey!

Muy bien, Fran. Very good.

Uno, dos, y tres.

Uno, dos, tres.

New steps, new steps.

New steps, new steps,

new steps.

New steps, new steps,

new steps, new steps.

New steps, new steps,

new steps!

New steps,

new steps, new steps...

There are no new steps!

I unequivocally state

there are no new steps...

ratified for

the Pan Pacific Grand Prix!

Comprende?

This is getting out of hand.

Oh! Ohh!

Oh, Charm, stop it!

I got to think.

Something's got to

be done about this.

If you can't dance the step,

you can't teach it.

If you can't teach it,

we might as well...

all pack up and go home.

With young Liz

available again...

you've got a chance to get

your status quo vadis back...

so to speak.

Barry, we've tried everything

we can to convince him!

- Except the truth.

- What do you mean?

Look, we all go back too far

to beat about the bush.

I know we agreed the past

should be left in the past...

but it's about time that lad

learned some home-truths...

about where this kind

of thing can lead.

I'd better fill

the drinks machine.

Ole!

Ole!

You are ready, kids!

Ha ha! You are ready.

Yes. They're ready.

We've tried everything

we can to convince him!

Except the truth.

Are you nervous about tomorrow?

Yeah. Are you?

I never thought we'd make it.

Me, neither.

Fran.

Yeah?

You know what I said

about the rumba...

and it being pretend?

Yeah?

Well...

What?

I think I made a mistake.

Oh, no!

What?

I promised Wayne I'd meet him

and help him with his...

Bogo pogo.

Better not keep him waiting.

Vivir con miedo

es como vivir a medias.

Wayne!

Wayne!

Wayne's not here.

Hope you don't mind.

We know we can't win...

but we're going

to dance anyway.

So let's not waste

each other's time.

He was the most beautiful dancer

I'd ever seen.

What?

He could have been the greatest

champion of them all.

But he was like you.

He threw it all away.

Who?

The man in this photograph.

What are you talking about?

I'm talking about the man

who was potentially...

the greatest ballroom dancer

this country's ever seen.

I'm talking about your father...

Doug Hastings.

Aw, come on.

Dad doesn't even dance.

You think it's funny?

You think it's funny, do you?

I worshipped that man.

We all did.

Doug Hastings was

an inspiration to us all.

But that's Les.

Les was Mum's partner.

No, Scott.

That's Doug.

I know to look at him today...

it's hard to believe,

but once...

Once...

Ah, once.

Doug and Shirley Hastings

were the best bloody couple...

this country had ever seen.

Couple number 100!

Doug and Shirley Hastings!

Couple number 100,

Doug and Shirley...

Couple number 100.

You know, Scott, your dad...

he had it all...

Looks, charm, confidence.

He had everything... everything.

My God, he was magnificent!

Grr!

Samba, cha-cha,

rumba, jive... anything.

He could do anything!

Brilliant!

All the girls loved him.

My goodness, he showed

those chickies a thing or two.

I was your dad's best mate

in those days.

Heh heh heh!

We'd just scruff it together,

you know, swing it around.

Lessie would come along,

of course.

The three of us together,

the old gang.

We were a bunch

of old funsters.

We all wanted to win,

of course...

but with your mum

as your dad's partner...

we had no chance.

They were magnificent.

Ooh, yeah

Take a look at me,

I'm yesterday's hero

Yesterday's hero

That's all I'll be

They had it

all before them...

a perfect career.

And then...

everything changed.

Your dad became,

I don't know...

self-obsessed,

focused on himself...

a selfish dancer.

I didn't know

what to make of it.

He started doing his own thing,

improvising...

throwing in crazy, wild,

crowd-pleasing steps.

A bit like yourself, Scott.

Not always...

strictly ballroom.

Shirley put up with it

for as long...

as she bloody well could.

It was only a matter of time...

before she eventually...

cracked.

I tried to warn him,

but, no, he wouldn't listen.

He wouldn't listen

to any of us.

He'd lost touch with reality.

He was convinced

he and your mum...

could win

the Pan Pacific Grand Prix...

dancing his own steps.

Of course, they lost.

Heh. I was lucky enough

to win that year.

The shock sent Doug crazy.

He vowed

he'd never dance again.

For a while there...

we didn't think

he'd pull through.

Slowly, little by little,

day by day...

he managed to crawl back

from the dark pit of despair...

and tack together

some semblance of a life.

When you were born,

Doug found a reason to live.

He vowed that one day...

you'd win the trophy

that he could never win.

That's why I've been

so hard on you, Scott.

For Doug to see you so close

and go the same way he went...

it would be too much

for him to bear.

I really think

it would kill him.

I managed to save this

as a souvenir.

Doug got rid of

everything else.

Don't tell anybody I've got it.

Why didn't anyone tell me?

Doug destroyed

your mother's career.

We had to keep it from you.

Your father's

a proud man, Scott.

He wouldn't want me to do this,

but I'm begging you.

Dance with Liz and win

the Pan Pacific once...

just once for Doug.

He's suffered enough, Scott.

Don't you think he deserves

a little happiness?

Ultimately, of course,

it's up to you.

You do what you think is best.

I know you'll make

the right decision.

Dance with Liz.

Win the Pan Pacific once,

just once for Doug.

He's suffered enough, Scott.

The Pan Pacific

Grand Prix!

Come on!

Put your hands together,

ladies and gentlemen...

for the magnificent

old-time Viennese.

Thank you, couples.

You may leave the floor.

Very good, darling.

Very good.

Straight down the line.

Couldn't fault it.

Yes, well-done.

Well-done. Well-done.

- Jesus, Ken!

- I only had one drink!

Poor Tina.

It's like dancing in a brewery.

Ha ha ha!

Couples

for the beginners final...

Please take the floor.

Look, Scott! It's Fran!

I didn't think she'd turn up.

Back in beginners

where she belongs.

And she stole my partner.

You made

the right decision, mate.

I know at times it's been

confusing for you, Scott...

but I'm speaking

for the whole studio...

when I say that

by putting your trust...

in the Federation,

you're doing the right thing.

And I think this will be

reflected in the results...

of the big one yet to come,

the Open Latin final.

We're right behind you, boy.

Son, can I bend your ear

for a tick?

Doug! Don't be stupid.

He's got to get ready

for the Latin.

I must get back

to the scrutineers table.

Go for it, boy.

Come on, come on,

come on, come on.
